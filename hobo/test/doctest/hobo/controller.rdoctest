# Authentication support

## authorized?

This method checks if the user is authorized. It returns true by default. Override this method in your controllers if you want to restrict access to only a few actions or if you want to check if the user has the correct rights.

Example:

      # only allow nonbobs
      def authorized?
        current_user.login != "bob"
      end

## login_required

This is used as a filter to control authentication.

To require logins for all actions, use this in your controllers:

    before_filter :login_required

To require logins for specific actions, use this in your controllers:

    before_filter :login_required, :only => [ :edit, :update ]

To skip this in a subclassed controller:

    skip_before_filter :login_required
