Hi,

    How I can route for user page goes to 'signup', with the form for create a new user ? How I can make this a root route ? I need only a page for collect emails and some data for use in future, when the app leave the beta stage... but my page appears with 'congratulations' message... I need user enter your informations, click in 'Save' and goes to congratulations page... simple, nothing more...

   Sorry for my terrible english...

Thanks.
