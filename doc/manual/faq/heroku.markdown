# How do I deploy to Heroku?

One of the last questions asked by the setup wizard is whether your
application will be deployed to Heroku. If you answer yes to that, nothing 
more should need to be done. However, if you answered
it in the negative or if it isn't working, there are two changes you
can make to help you run on Heroku or anywhere else with a read-only
file system.

*Check in your autogenerated files*.   The setup wizard may add these two lines to your `.gitignore`:

    app/views/taglibs/auto/**/*
    config/hobo_routes.rb

Remove these lines from `.gitignore`, and check those files in to git.

*config.hobo.read_only_file_system*.   Hobo should autodetect Heroku, but if it fails, add

    config.hobo.read_only_file_system = true

to config/environments/production.rb
