# How to use controller buttons in table-plus?

Originally written by Niko on 2008-10-29.

What is the recommended way to use for example a "delete-button" inside your table-plus construct?  

With <delete-button update="self"/> I do see the alert box and the spinning "Removing..." overlay, but there seems to be no controller called on the back-end side...
