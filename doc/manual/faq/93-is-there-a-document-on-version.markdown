# Is there a document on version 1.0x versus 1.3?

Originally written by kgeorgeson on 2011-02-22.

I am trying to follow the awesome guide rapid-rails-with-hobo, but obviously some things are very different in v1.3.   I have worked out things like...

ruby script/generate hobo_migration =>  rails generate hobo:migration

But some of the finer points are holding me back.   E.g. ViewHints has disappeared?   I have discovered that "children" works now in the model, but where have field_name and field_help gone to?

I can't find through lots of different google searches where I might find any documentation that provides an overview of what has changed... and where to find things now.
