# How can i translate everything.

Originally written by tonlap on 2010-08-30.

Hello, we try to create a new hobo project in german.
But when we manipulate the dryml files, some parts remain unchanged.
For example the "canel" button:

<or-cancel param="cancel"/>

What can i do with it to change "Cancel" to "Abbrechen"?
