# Internationalization i18n

Originally written by charlesdeb on 2010-10-10.

Dear folks,

Does anyone have any simple code that they have use to internationalise a project? The hobo documentation explains how to set up the translation keys - and that works fine for me. I am wondering more about what I need to do to set up language choice drop downs and then have my URLs reflect that. I have tried following the info on the Rails website, but Hobo seems to break a couple of their suggestions. 

cheers,
