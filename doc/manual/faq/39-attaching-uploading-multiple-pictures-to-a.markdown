# Attaching/uploading multiple pictures to a model

Originally written by salamandyr on 2009-12-24.

I'd like a recipe that walks through how to associate multiple image uploads with a single model instance, e.g. allow browse/attach for one to many images when adding a new item to a model, or editing an existing item in the model.

Thanks!  :)
