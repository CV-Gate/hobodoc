# User states when account isn't immediately active

I have a quick query about user states, and the default messages that
are shown,

I am just wondering how to edit the default messages that are shown
when an account is either inactive,

or pending.

i.e after a user signs up, and then immediately signs in, the site
will show 'your account is not available at this time'

Is this message editable? - the URL points to /login, but login.dryml
doesn't seem to contain this? and I can't seem to find anything in
rapid?

Thanks
