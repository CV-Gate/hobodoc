# Change "Add `<ModelName>`" from select area in 1..n relation

Originally written by kevinpfromnm on 2010-08-04.

Hi all,

I have 1...n relation and hobo creates a select area for it. In this
select area the selected item is "Add <ModelName>".
Can anyone tell me how to change the text in this select area?
I've already did this for a 1...1 relation but I don't know how to do
this in a 1...n relation.

Thanks.
Best regards,
Hugo
