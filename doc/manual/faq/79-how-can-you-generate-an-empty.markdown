# How can you generate an empty page?

Originally written by tonlap on 2010-08-30.

We created a calender with a rails plugin and it worked. Now we have the calender-page and we try to implemt it inside a ne page. But how do you create one?
When you generate a new page without any database customizations there is an error.
We can create the menu entry but can't create the rest like there is at Home.

I like the approach of Hobo but it's not so easy to get started with.
