# How Do I Get Help?

The fastest way to get an answer is by asking in [Hobo Users](http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers).  Before asking, it is recommended to search the documentation (the manual you are reading right now) and the Hobo Users archive. You might not be the first person with the same question!
