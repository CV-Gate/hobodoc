# `hobo thingybob` returns "Command Not Found"

Originally written by eengnerd on 2010-07-19.

I successfully installed rails and generated a rails app connected to mysql database and then issued the command:

    sudo gem install hobo

which ran just fine.

Then typed the command:

    hobo thingybob

and got the message:

    "Command not found"

Why not?
