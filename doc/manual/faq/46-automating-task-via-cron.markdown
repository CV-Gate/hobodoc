# Automating task via cron

Originally written by cbenedict on 2010-07-18.

How would I go about creating a task that loads the hobo environment, logs me in as administrator, and allows me to call methods on models without having to build methods on controllers to fake this out (and then calling wget or some such via cron)?  The use case is sending out daily email reminders.  Thanks in advance.
