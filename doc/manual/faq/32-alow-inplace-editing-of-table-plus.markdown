# Alow inplace editing of table-plus fields

Originally written by Clarksta on 2009-04-22.

Sometimes its a step too far to click the edit control on a table row to view the edit page for that row. So for example in the Agility tutorial, allow editing of the status of a story in the table-plus on the project show page. (Just like the ajaxified editor right on the story page)
