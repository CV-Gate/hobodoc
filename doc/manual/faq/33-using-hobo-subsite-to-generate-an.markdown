# Using hobo_subsite to generate an admin interface?

This question answered by recipe: [Create an admin subsite](/tutorials/3-create-an-admin-subsite)

I didn't find anything easy to understand in the Hobo Users Google Group, nor elsewhere on this site or Google, so here goes:

If I have a new Hobo app at, let's say "www.mydomain.com", with some models and controllers and so on, how do I use hobo_subsite to generate an admin interface for "www.mydomain.com/admin" that would let me access the various models (tables?) and do all the usual admin stuff like adding and removing users and so on?

I apologise if this is the wrong place to post this question - I'm new to the whole Rails and Hobo world, and am terribly excited by the possibilities, but somewhat stumped on documentation.

Kind regards,
