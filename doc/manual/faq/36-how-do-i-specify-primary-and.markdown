# How do I specify primary and foreign keys for legacy tables?

Originally written by smvanbru on 2009-06-29.

I have live legacy tables that I'd like to access with Hobo. 

As such, I'd like to create models around them, but not modify them.  One thing I need to do in the models, is specify what the the primary key and foreign keys are.  How do I do this with Hobo models?

Thanks!
