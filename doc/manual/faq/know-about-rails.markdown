# What do you need to know about Rails to get started?

Hobo is built on top of Rails. This is great because there are tons of documentation written for Rails, and you can use that to improve your Hobo application. Spending some time reading about Rails and even trying to create a vanilla Rails application will probably be very useful.

You can start with the official Rails guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
