# Limit a classified site to one region ?

Originally written by daveporter on 2008-10-30.

OK We have a site something like the POD Classified app...

I have a similar application in development, but for vehicles.

But I'm in Australia and if someone is in Queensland they would not want to look at cars in Western Australia for example.

So I want to know how to limit the viewing of classified vehicles to one state, being a drop down control always visible ?
