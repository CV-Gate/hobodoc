# How do you organize your .dryml

Originally written by pehrlich on 2010-11-11.

What do you find works best for keeping your pages and extensions neat and organized?  When you extend a page, do you keep the parameter tags in the order that they appear, or just whichever way you ended up writing them?  Or do sort them in some other way, such as wording vs layout vs data?

How about your application.dryml, what works best there?
