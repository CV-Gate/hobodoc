# Periodic Ajax Refresh

Originally written by Etern on 2010-09-25.

Hi All,

I'm looking for a way to have my ajax hobo page automatically request for new data from the server every X seconds. I know for rails, you can use 'periodically_call_remote', but that doesn't seem to tie in with the update/part/part-local structure of hobo.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.
