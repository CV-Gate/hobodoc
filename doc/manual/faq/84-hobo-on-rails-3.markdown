# Hobo on Rails 3??

Originally written by cip on 2010-11-07.

Hi,

I've installed the latest (pre) hobo on rails on Rails 3.0.1.

I tried to find documentation for the new Hobo behaviors, but I couldn't.

I have noticed that there are various functionalities are different. For example: hobo_model_resource is not working, the generated controllers are different, the routes are different ...etc.

I'm kinda new to this stuff, so I'd highly appreciate some documentation/tutorial on working with hobo on rails 3.

Thanks
