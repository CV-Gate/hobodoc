# What's the difference between Datamapper and Hobo Fields?

DataMapper and HoboFields both allow you to define and maintain your scheme inside of your models.   The big difference is that HoboFields is an extension to ActiveRecord while DataMapper replaces ActiveRecord.

You can use DataMapper or any other ORM in your Hobo application, but you also lose [Rich Types](/manual/hobo_fields/rich_types).
