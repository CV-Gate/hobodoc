# How do I change the order of  fields in my form or show page?

Originally written by kevinpfromnm on 2010-08-22.

It appear that by default text, date and text area input objects are shown
in a New or Edit page prior to any relational input objects, such as
dropdown combos.  Is there any way to specify the order without resorting to
too much .dryml?
