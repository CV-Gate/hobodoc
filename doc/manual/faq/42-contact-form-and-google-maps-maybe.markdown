This question answered by recipe: [Integrating Google Maps with Hobo](/tutorials/50-integrating-google-maps-with-hobo)

Hi people, I'm new with ruby and after I study a little bit, end up with Hobo :-). I'm not experienced programmer still learning, so I try to made my first app with hobo. I know that I maybe ask to much, but if is possible to make recipes for simple contact form and explain how to work with sending emails (for registration, general contact, changing password..). Also how to work with google maps (geocoding). For start, only this :-). BTW, sorry for my bad English, I'm from Croatia.

Thanks in advance.
