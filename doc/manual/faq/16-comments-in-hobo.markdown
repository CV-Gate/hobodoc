This question answered by recipe: [Simple Cross-Model Comments](/tutorials/7-simple-cross-model-comments)

I've been trying to get acts_as_commentable working in Hobo. 

Tom also pointed out a part of hobo called Rapid Comments (http://github.com/jgarlick/rapid_comments) but thats totally undocumented at the moment. 

So I wrote my own and realised how easy it is! See recipe link below.
