# Are there any editors that cope with DRYML?

Textmate:  [hobo-tmbundle](https://github.com/drnic/hobo-tmbundle)

VI: [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) &&
[hobo-vim](https://github.com/solars/hobo-vim)

Any other editor that knows how to deal with .html.erb files also
generally works well for DRYML.  Emacs users [have several
choices](http://rinari.rubyforge.org/Rhtml-Setup.html#Rhtml-Setup).
RadRails is also used by others in the community.
