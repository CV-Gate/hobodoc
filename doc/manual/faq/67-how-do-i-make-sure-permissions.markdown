# How do I make sure permissions are right for each model/user?

Originally written by kevinpfromnm on 2010-08-08.

It would be very useful to have a section with "effective permissions"
for user/objects on the summary page. Let's say I want to know what
user Bob can do. That's not easy to track down manually, and I fear
that I might have given an user to many rights.

How do you guys make sure that nothing slips through?
