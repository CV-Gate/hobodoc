# Dynamic select menus

Originally written by marton on 2010-02-22.

I would like to see how to link/filter two selectors in a form or as inline editor fields.
when choosing one, the second list is refreshed.
these are typical Select-one (or belongs-to).

Railscasts.com have a screencast on this topic for generic rails: http://railscasts.com/episodes/88-dynamic-select-menus
