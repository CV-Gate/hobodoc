# RIA's, "Fit Clients", and hobo?

Hello there.  I posted a question awhile ago regarding making Rich Internet Applications (RIA's) with Hobo and AJAX.  I was able to get some nice features working with iFRAMEs and a few tricks.  But I think this article below speaks to the complexity and hype of AJAX-ified Desktops.

Im curious if anyone has looked at Adobe AIR or Flex for RIAs with hobo?  

Also, has anyone used this framework?

Thanks!
