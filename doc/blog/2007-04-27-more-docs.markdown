    <p>Awesome job on the docs. I learnt a bunch of stuff going through them... even after I thought I'd read the code thoroughly :)</p>

    <p>You might have  a look at <a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow">Maruku</a> for creating your PDF.  It looks like it might be able to do what you need.</p>

    <p>Great, I really like what you are doing with Hobo. IMO the best plug-in for Rails I've seen yet.</p>

Just posted: another update to the manual. There's now an overview of the Hobo Rapid tags. I am now officially bored of the manual, for the time-being at least. I want to do something fun like implementing local tags :-)

p.s. As I mentioned a while back, the manual source is in Markdown, and the PDF manual is generated by Safari from HTML + CSS. Anyone got any bright ideas for getting a contents page with page numbers on it?
