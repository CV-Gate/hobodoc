    <p>You're probably already aware, but something is causing a NoMethodError in Front#index.</p>
    
    <p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
    
    <p>hobo test
    script/generate hobo<em>model</em>resource aresource
    script/generate hobo_migration   (respond m)
    script/server</p>
    
    <p>And that's it.  Attempt to browse http://localhost:3000 and I get:</p>
    
    <p>undefined method `model' for #</p>

    <p>OK, that was embarassing.  Not only did the first release fail epically, the quick hack fix was also broken.  Look for 0.9.102 in a couple of minutes...</p>

I'm proud to announce that we've just released Hobo 1.0RC1 to gemcutter and rubyforge.  It's named 0.9.100 just in case any of you still have old versions of rubygems and don't want to upgrade.

The fixes came fast and furiously in the last two weeks, and we took the opportunity to make a couple of small API changes before we locked down for 1.0.  The biggest change was the removal of the ":dependent => :destroy" magic.  Hobo no longer uses ":dependent => :destroy" to determine your primary collection.  You will have to add "children" declarations in your viewhints files if you were depending on this behaviour.   There's a [new step in the agility tutorial](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/tutorials/agility#viewhints-children) that talks about this.  There's also a new agility chapter for [translations](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/tutorials/agility#translating_the_application).

At this point we're frozen for 1.0.  From now on only critical and documentation and testing bugs will be fixed on our 1.0 branch.   I'm also proud to announce that there are currently 0 critical bugs on our [bugtracker](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/bins/8323).  I expect you to change that quickly, but it feels pretty good to get it down to 0, even for a brief moment!  Unfortunately, the Lighthouse doesn't contain all of our documentation and testing bugs, because there aren't many of those on there either.

Matt Jones (al2o3cr) and Tom Locke made significant contributions to this release.

### Changelog

Deletions:

  - Children must now be specified in the viewhints.   Hobo no longer
    uses the presence of :dependent => :destroy to determine the
    primary child association.

  - The bundles feature of Hobo which never really worked and was
    never documented has been removed from this release.

  - The message "You must activate your account before you can log
    in. Please check your email." which used to be added to the flash
    message when a user has signed up has been removed from
    `hobo_do_signup`.

  - The fix for
    [#556](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/556)
    means that the migration generator now ignores all models that have
    a `hobo_model` declaration but not a `fields` declaration.  If you
    have any models that do not have a fields declaration (join
    tables, for example), you may wish to add a blank fields
    declaration.

Major enhancements:

  - Hobo now supports Ruby 1.9.1.  Problems have been encountered with
    Ruby 1.9.1 and Rails 2.3.4.  Rails 2.3.3 and 2.3.5 work fine.

  - Hobo has been tested against the new Rails 2.3.5.  JRuby users may
    encounter [Rails bug 3497](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3497)

  - Rails 2.2 is still supported for this release.   Support for 2.2
    may be dropped post-1.0.

  - Translations (ie, the ht functions) has now been moved into its
    own module.  To access the translation functions from elsewhere
    use `Hobo::Translations.ht`.  Alternatively, including the
    Hobo::Translations module into your class will give you `ht` as a
    local instance method.  (This is one of the things the
    `hobo_controller` declaration does.)

  - `rake hobo:run_invite_only_generators` was added as an alternative
    to `rake hobo:run_standard_generators` for those who created their
    application with the `--invite-only` flag

  - [#409](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/409)
    The `<editor>` tag has been modified to display the `to_s`
    representation of the object while in edit mode.  The `to_html`
    representation is still used in view mode.  The editor tag for
    HTML columns has been modified to remove the heavy sanitizing that
    was previously performed.  HtmlString will sanitize before saving
    to the database.  You need to update your hobo-rapid.js for this
    fix.  Run `rake hobo:run_standard_generators` or copy the file
    directly from [github](http://github.com/tablatom/hobo/blob/master/hobo/rails_generators/hobo_rapid/templates/hobo-rapid.js)

  - [#296](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/296)
    The migration generator now fully understands HABTM join tables. Note that
    the "decorated join table" functionality that was deprecated in Rails 2.3
    is NOT supported.

  - [#475](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/475)
    User-defined rich types are now loaded from `RAILS_ROOT/app/rich_types`, if it exists.

  - EnumString's can now be translated.  The
    [manual](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/hobofields/rich_types)
    has been updated with the details.

  - ViewHint's can now be translated.  Well, they mostly could in 0.9,
    but it has been cleaned up and [documented with
    ViewHints](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/viewhints).

  - Lifecycle states can now be translated. The key is
    `#{table_name}.states.#{state}`  Transitions use the key `#{table_name}.actions.#{transition}`

Major bug fixes:

  - [#537](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/537)
    The `._?.` "smart dot" now returns 'nil' rather than calling its
    trailing function more often than it used to, more closely
    matching its documentation.

  - [#457](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/457)
    ie7-recalc.js has been updated to improve compatibility with IE6.
    Please update the copy inside of your application, either by
    running `rake hobo:run_standard_generators` or by copying the file
    directly from [github](http://github.com/tablatom/hobo/blob/master/hobo/rails_generators/hobo_rapid/templates/ie7-recalc.js)

  - [#512](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/512)
    Hobo now has better compatibility with non-DRYML templates

Minor enhancements:

  - [#554](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/554)
    The transition-buttons tag no longer displays transitions that are
    not `:available_to` the user.

  - [#536](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/536)
    documentation for field-list more closely matches reality

  - [#536](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/543)
    i18n has been silenced.  It's messages can be made to reappear on
    the log via `HOBO_VERBOSE_TRANSLATIONS`.

  - [#555](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324-hobo/tickets/555)
    Specifying ignore_index :foo will ignore the index named 'foo' on the model
    when generating migrations - handy for indexes that can't be generated
    automatically (with a prefix length on MySQL, for instance) or existing
    indexes in legacy tables.
