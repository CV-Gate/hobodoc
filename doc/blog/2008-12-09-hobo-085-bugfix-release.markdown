    <p>Heh, global economic meltdowns usually come with some sort of silver lining for productivity improvement tools. :-)</p>

I've just released Hobo 0.8.5. There was a problem with running Hobo as a gem which slipped into the short-lived 0.8.4 release. A few more fixes made it in to this release too, mostly in the new permissions system.

See the [changes](/gems/CHANGES.txt) for the details. As always, remember that Rubyforge takes a good while to catch up, so `gem update hobo` might not work for a while. You can download the gem files from Rubyforge manually though.

That's pretty much me done for the year -- I'm taking some time off now. And what a year it's been. Progress has accelerated dramatically since our sponsors [Barquin International](http://barquin.com/) came on board. We wouldn't be remotely close to where we are now, especially in terms of [documentation](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net), without their support. So I'd like to say a very big thank you to Owen and the team over at Barquin.

It feels like we're in great shape for a very exciting 2009 with Hobo. Just in time for the meltdown of the entire global economy. Heh - you win some you lose some : )
