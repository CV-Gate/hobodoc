    <p>Great! :-) Now force yourself to write that documentation, even if it is boring work, because we hobo users really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>I love the "migrations" in the models. I hope something like this gets into edge!</p>
    
    <p>The migrations? Are? Inside the model? Ooo Ah ah ah! Ooo! Ooo!</p>

    <p>hachaboob - just to clarify, the migrations aren't really in the model. Migrations are still the same, but the field declarations are in the model and the migrations are generated automatically.</p>
    
    <p>Just thought I'd clarify that for people that haven't used it and might think all the migration code goes in the model.</p>

And finally...

 * [Hobo-0.6.gem](/gems/hobo-0.6.gem)
 * [Change Log](/gems/CHANGES.txt)
 
Also note we're now on rubyforge so you could always just `gem update hobo` (subject to rubyforge delays -- I only threw it up there one minute ago)
 
The demos on the site have not been updated, nor has the manual I'm afraid to say. But work on updating the manual is already underway so hopefully it won't be all that long.

Have fun!
