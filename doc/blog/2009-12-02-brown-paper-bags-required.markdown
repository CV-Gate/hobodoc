    <p>No worries.  Glitches happen.  That's why there are release "Candidates."  You've done an epic job on Hobo!</p>

Even though I'm sure I did a smoke test on the gem before releasing, 0.9.100 was an epic fail.  Please download 0.9.102.

You know, one thing I've significantly improved in Hobo since taking over maintenance from Tom has been the test suite.  Regardless, I seem to consistently require brown paper bag releases, but I don't see any of them in Tom's history.
