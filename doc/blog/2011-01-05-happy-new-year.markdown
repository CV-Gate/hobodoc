    <p>I would also like to thanks the key members that are answering questions and providing insight to the Hobo Users Group.  Of course Tom Locke, Bryan Larsen, and Matt Jones are well know, but Kevin Porter now has the record number of posts according to the google groups stats...</p>

This is just a quick post to wish all of you in the Hobo community the best for 2011.

We are soon approaching the release of Hobo 1.3 for Rails 3 (now at pre-release #25  and hope to have a draft of the PDF book "Rapid Rails 3 with Hobo"  completed by the end of January.   Thanks much to Domizio for all his hard work on 1.3 and his helpful documentation and edits to the 1.0 versions of "Rapid Rails with Hobo" and "Hobo at Work", which Venka has incorporated up through Chapter 4 of the new version.

I hope that Hobo, Rails, and Ruby have made your app building more productive and fun.

Cheers!
