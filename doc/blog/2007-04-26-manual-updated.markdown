I've just uploaded a new version of the manual. Highlights of the new content are:

[DRYML:](/manual/chapters/3_dryml.html)

 * Dynamic inner-tags

[Hobo Model Controller:](/manual/chapters/4_hobo_model_controller.html)

 * Controller customisation
 * Controller data filters
 * Auto-complete (the controller side of things only)

Probably most significant is the controller customisation stuff. I've mentioned the new mechanism in a blog-post or two, but now the whole set of options is documented.

Enjoy.
