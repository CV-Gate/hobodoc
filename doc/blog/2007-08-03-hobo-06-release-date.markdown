    <p>Also, while cheers are in order, just wanted to note that I went from zero Ruby knowledge in January, to preparing to deploy the first version of an intranet application for my company later this month, and a lot of it is thanks to Hobo.  Looking forward to continuing to develop with it in the future.</p>

It seems you're all itching to know when we'll have a Hobo 0.6 without the 'pre' tag :-)

Just to let you know we're shooting for Tuesday the week after next -- 14th August.
