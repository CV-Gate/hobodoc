    <p>Please don't believe that screencasts are substitutes for written documentation.  Hobo is still in serious need for clear, complete, and comprehensive written documentation, and until it produces it, the project will never grow at the rate it should because it will continue to remain a mystical programming paradigm versus a functional application building tool.</p>

    <p>Excellent! Yes, please do encourage the conference folks to record your presentation. I'll even volunteer to convert it into a webcast (I do that kind of thing as part of my job). Webcasts are very handy, as is textual and rdoc style documentation, but webcasts are particularly friendly. Once people see how it's done, maybe there can be more of a community contributions to the documentary project through things like personal blogs. Have fun, Tom!</p>

    <p>Great news, but we REALLY need documentation.  I thought the project might be dead as haven't seen entries in my RSS reader for a long time.  I also keep looking at beta.hobocentral.net and don't see any updates.</p>
    
    <p>Any updates?</p>
    
    <p>Thanks.</p>

    <p>Does Hobo work with Facebook? I am trying to write a Facebook Canvas application. Is Hobo the right tool for the job? I am trying to use it with Facebooker plugin.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks</p>

The kind fools at the [Ruby Fools Conference](http://jaoo.dk/ruby-cph/conference/) have invited me to give a presentation on Hobo in Copenhagen on April 2nd. This will be the third time I've stood up to talk about Hobo and both times it's been really difficult to cover such a big topic in a short time. So I made a suggestion -- how about a railsconf style three hour tutorial? To which they replied with an enthusiastic "yes!".

Three hours should be enough time to build a complete Facebook clone and still have time for a relaxed chat about Danish history. Well, um, it should be enough time to build a decent demo app and get some experience with all of the main features of Hobo. Excellent! The tutorial is scheduled for March 31st, which I believe is the day before the presentations start. The tutorial is in addition to the one hour presentation which is on the 2nd.

Would be great to meet some more of you Hobo people face-to-face.

If you're coming, say so in the comments :-)

Should be fun!

p.s. As I'm writing this the details they have for me on the conference website are kinda broken, and my face is that of a white fuzzy blob. Should all be fixed up shortly :-)
