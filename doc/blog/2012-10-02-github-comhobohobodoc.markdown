Github has made [Hobo/hobodoc](https://github.com/Hobo/hobodoc) a publicly pushable repository for us, just like [docrails](https://github.com/lifo/docrails).   We'll use the [same rules](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/7/what-is-docrails/) that docrails uses.

This means that those "Edit this page" links in the cookbook are now even easier to use.   You no longer need to create a pull request, just edit the file and click save!   Any excuses you had for not updating documentation should be gone now.

I've updated the default version for the [cookbook](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net) to 2.0.   If you're still using 1.3 please make sure you adjust the version selector at the top.
