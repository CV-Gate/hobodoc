    <p>This is really cool! thanks for all your hard work Tom! I've gone through the screencasts again and I should say that they thouroughly reward the repeat visitor! :) </p>
    
    <p>I was actually thinking of doing a hobo for dummies type thing that would run off of a configuration file and create a fully functional site. I tend to think hobo has made thnigs  <em>that</em> easy. even for occasional ruby/rails dabblers like myself!  :)</p>
    
    <p>keep up the good work!</p>

    <p>This is great news, Tom!
    I was wondering if you have any ETA for the next version of Hobo and any idea of what it'll bring to the table in terms of new features and/or perf improvements.
    Thanks!</p>

    <p>Franck - Really not sure about Hobo 0.5.4 at the moment - we're taking a hard look at cleaning some things up, and also addressing performance. There'll probably be a bigger than usual gap this time.</p>

    <p>Sounds very good. It doesn't matter that the gap's bigger if it's for the better.
    I perfectly understand that you don't want to commit in time for 0.5.4. Though, are we talking days, weeks, months, quarters?
    Thanks!</p>

    <p>Congratulations!!!</p>
    
    <p>Yep I was "surprised" (read: delighted) when I see things like 't.string' in "my" migrations. What are those?</p>
    
    <p>So they're Hobo extensions? Cool!</p>
    
    <p>Glad they made it into Rails... So good :)</p>

    <p>Frank - I'd say maybe 4 to 6 weeks, but that's really just a wild guess.</p>

    <p>This is not a complaint... (maybe a prod :O) but as I'm about to start another two projects that would really love to be hobo'd... I'm wondering how close we are to a 0.6-preX or whatever the new stuff is going to be...</p>

Hi folks, sorry to be a bit quiet of late. Just thought I'd update you with a few bits and bobs from the Hobo world.

There's been a few interesting sightings of Hobo out there. By now you've probably seen Dr Nic's [myconfplan](http://www.myconfplan.com), which uses Hobo. I've been meaning to ping some questions over to Dr Nic about the experience of using Hobo in that app, so hopefully that'll be a blog post soon.

If you've paid attention to RailsConf, you may have noticed that a very tiny corner of Hobo -- the compact `create_table` migration syntax -- has found it's way into core Rails. It seems DHH came across the "Sexy Migrations" post on err the blog. Nice!

The guys over at Bugzilla have taken a look at Hobo as one option (of many!) for a [new implementation of Bugzilla](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Languages).

Niko Dittmann will be doing a presentation on Hobo at the German language [Rails Konferenz](http://rails-konferenz.de/programm) (German language link, here's the [hilarious automatic translation](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Frails-konferenz.de%2Fprogramm&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=EN&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools))

Meanwhile I'm hoping to get my proposal accepted for a talk on Hobo at RailsConf Europe. 

Behind the scenes things are very busy at Hobo Central. We have a ton of client work on, all of which will be pushing the quality and feature-set of Hobo along in leaps and bounds. And of course, all this professional work puts HoboTech Ltd. on a sound financial footing, so the Hobo project will continue to be very active for the foreseeable future.

Good times!
