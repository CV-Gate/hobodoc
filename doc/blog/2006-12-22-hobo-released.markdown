    <p>Stunning. Elegant in its operation and delivers the goods.</p>
    
    <p>I love rails as it offers a fantastic core framework from which to deliver high quality applications. But it clearly stops short of complete automation; some might say for good reason.</p>
    
    <p>But, on first impressions, Hobo fills this gap in an effective way by automating stuff that really should be automated, such as Ajax. It focuses your attention  on building features and not on extending the Rails framework. It also builds repeatable features automatically, such as login and account signup. Pretty cool stuff!</p>
    
    <p>The web is in a new infancy of intuitive and interactive UI driven apps and Hobo increases the opportunities for more developers to get involved.</p>
    
    <p>Great work!</p>

    <p>The hobo gem is linked to a later version of rails 1.1.6 than the standard current release!</p>
    
    <p>Don't forget to update using</p>
    
    <p>sudo gem update --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org -y</p>
    
    <p>first.</p>
    
    <p>Unless of course Rails 1.2 (or later!) has been released when you read this.</p>

    <p>Looks nice, though could you provide the screencasts in a more portable format (just a plain mpeg file)?</p>

    <p>I really love this name (hobo) . It is not pretentious like some other product names I've seen floating around, and still, the product seems to pack quite a punch. I'm hoping to check it out this weekend!!!</p>

    <p>I've been playing around with this for a while now and it's great... But I have one question that I can't seem  to get over... How did you get Terminal.app to look/act like that in the screencast. At first I thought  it was some other app but I can only find 2 really lame replacements! This must be a plugin or something right? I need it! :)</p>
    
    <p>Keep up the great work!</p>

## Getting Hobo

Note Hobo requires Rails 1.2 RC1, which you can install like this:

    gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org -y

You should read the [status](/blog/status) page before downloading Hobo.

Hobo is distributed in two forms, a gem and a plugin (svn repo).

### Hobo Gem

The gem is ideal for trying out Hobo with a new app. It gives you a single command:

    $ hobo <app-name>

It works just like the `rails` command, creating a blank Rails application pre-configured for Hobo. First download the gem:

  * [hobo-0.4.0.gem](/gems/hobo-0.4.0.gem)

Then:

	$ gem install hobo-0.4.0.gem
	
(Sorry folks we've not got our Rubyforge stuff together as yet)

### Hobo plugin

If you want to add Hobo to an existing application, first do:

	$ ./script/plugin install svn://hobocentral.net/hobo/trunk
    $ ./script/generate hobo

Then there are a few optional steps, depending on which Hobo features you're after. In the screencast you've seen:

#### Hobo Rapid and the default theme:

	$ ./script/generate hobo_rapid
	
#### Hobo's user model:

	$ ./script/generate hobo_model user
	
#### The automatic front page, signup/login and search:

    $ ./script/generate hobo_front_controller front
	
More documentation will follow!
