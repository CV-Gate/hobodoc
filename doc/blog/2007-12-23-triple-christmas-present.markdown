    <p>I have been checking out beta.hobocentral.net. It's very useful and interesting - it shows off Hobo operations quite well.</p>
    
    <p>I do have this question: Where is the welcome message ("This site has been created as an open-source example of creating an app using the Hobo framework. It's at a very early stage at the moment, and, as you have probably noticed, there's not a lot of data! The source code to this app is available here") defined?</p>
    
    <p>Thanks.</p>
    
    <p>Pd</p>

    <p>Great. Thank you! :-)</p>
    
    <p>"Like everything in Hobo, the tutorial is very much a work in progress. At the moment it ends a bit abruptly just as things start to get interesting with DRYML."</p>
    
    <p>Now don't let us wait long for the continuation...</p>

title: Triple Christmas Present
excerpt: |+
  There is a *lot* to tell you about. I could blog on and on. In fact I intended to. But you know what, I'm supposed to be on holiday! So, I'll cut straight to the chase and get off this computer :-)
  
  For your hobo-ing pleasure there are three new goodies today, and I'm finally making good on my "Docs Month" promise (December *is* docs month!). The more I put time into documenting Hobo the more I realise what a huge task it is to produce in-depth documentation. But the beginnings are in place.

There is a *lot* to tell you about. I could blog on and on. In fact I intended to. But you know what, I'm supposed to be on holiday! So, I'll cut straight to the chase and get off this computer :-)

For your hobo-ing pleasure there are three new goodies today, and I'm finally making good on my "Docs Month" promise (December *is* docs month!). The more I put time into documenting Hobo the more I realise what a huge task it is to produce in-depth documentation. But the beginnings are in place.

<a id="more"></a><a id="more-188"></a>

Please see the [docs](/blog/docs) page for:

  * The new Hobo tutorial!
  * The source-code to beta.hobocentral.net!
  
Both, of course, are at an early stage.

And, just in case two christmas presents are not enough, Hobo 0.7.1 is out. Hobo 0.7.1 features the new Clean theme as the default along with *hugely* improved default pages and much more besides. The out-of-the-box Hobo app with no work at all in the view layer is starting to look really good.

So go `gem update hobo` or `svn up` your plugin directory, and don't forget to [read the changelog](/gems/CHANGES.txt)

Happy Christmas! See you next year.
