    <p>Hey folks, not much movement here. The old documentation and tutorials are actually making it really hard to work through a simple example.  I've got that there are big changes in the 1.3 version and I'm struggling to figure out whether or not to move forward on my project using Hobo, or abandon Hobo on account of the lagging docs.</p>
    
    <p>I don't mean to complain, hey it's free after all, but you've done such an awesome job from what I've seen that I'd hate to see this fall by the wayside for lack of documentation &amp; tutorials.</p>

    <p>I've been going through the tutorials in 1.3 and after a bit of struggle getting started, seem to be doing ok with 1.3.0.RC2 and uninstalling 1.3.0.pre26.  I did the first tutorial in a kind of convoluted way by creating the project, altering the gemfile to update to the latest branch, and then updating hobo from within there (having started with pre26).  Second tutorial seems to be working fine (with minor differences in views) using RC2.</p>

After a ton of work from Domizio and the rest of the team, we are finally ready with a Hobo 1.3 (aka Hobo for Rails 3) release candidate!

You can install the release candidate with

    gem install hobo -v 1.3.0.RC

In addition to Rails 3 support there are a ton of improvements to Hobo in this release. We have a new routing system where you can see all the generated routes in `config/hobo_routes.rb`. There is the new app-creation wizard to get you started even more easily with new projects. There are also many improvements internally, especially in the way Hobo interfaces with Rails, which will make it much easier to keep Hobo compatible with new versions of Rails.

We'll be letting you know more about the improvements in Hobo 1.3 in some forthcoming blog posts.
