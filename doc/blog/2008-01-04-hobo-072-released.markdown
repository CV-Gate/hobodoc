    <p>Tom,</p>
    
    <p>It seems to be broken. See <a href="http://hobocentral.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3950" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

    <p>Sergei - v strange. That method should be available. It's working fine here. Let's continue in the forums.</p>

    <p>Tom,</p>
    
    <p>I'd like to make this suggestion.</p>
    
    <p>Get an account at www.heroku.com and do
    your betasite development there too, and make it public.
    Everyone will be able to see the code, but only those
    you would chose to have edit permission could change it.</p>
    
    <p>I have an account, and can send you and email invitation
    to make it quicker to join.</p>
    
    <p>Today I installed the hobo gem in my practice app, but 
    haven't figured out how to run it to make a hobo_app.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, a suggestion.</p>

    <p>Jabari - if by "betasite" you mean beta.hobocentral.net, all the code is available and can be found here: </p>
    
    <p>http://dev.hobocentral.net/trac/browser/trunk/hobocentral</p>

    <p>OK. I going to try and import the betasite code into
    Heroku and get it to run.  If I do, I'll make the url
    public so everybody can see it.</p>

    <p>Thank you Tom,
    since months I follow the development and evolution process of Hobo, and since the clean-up of DRYML I am totally convinced by and sold on the concepts of Hobo. Nevertheless as I found myself yesterday writing a tag before figuring out the view tag has its own format attribute, I - as many others - wished to have more docs at hand, although I spent several hours skimming through the Changelog and the sources. Instead of just complaining I'd like to make a proposal: What about getting back to basics and commenting the code for letting good old rdoc doing the rest (at least for he ruby code)? Some comments in the taglib files and another README comprising a short overview in focusing on where to find what, and I assume most of us standard rails nerds will be satisfied at first. These comments could grow version by version as You  (and hopefully others) code along. The drawback on this approach is, that writing the comments is hardly (if at all) delegable due to synchronicity reasons.
    I really appreciate Your efforts on the tutorial and the beta.hobocentral.net; the latter may clarify the demo application but IMHO does not help hobo users to get new things done, on the other hand taking some of Your precious time.
    Anyhow, if You can think of a way in supporting You in commenting the code, please let me know.
    And BTW: Happy New Year!</p>

    <p>First - very cool stuff you have going on here.
    Second - I downloaded and installed and went through tutorial.  I was beating my head against the wall (not really) because I couldnt' get the Log In / Sign Up stuff in the project like you had on the tutorial.  After many different attempts at various stuff, I finally loaded the darn thing in FF and there it was!  :-)  I use IE as my default browser.  Low and Behold...it is there, you just can't tell because it's all white, like the text.  LOL...just thought I would let you know in case anyone else gets to experience this fun.</p>
    
    <p>One additional thing:  The lowpro.js file that's included gave me script errors on IE from the very first page.  I downloaded a slightly newer version from lowpro's website and the errors went away.</p>

    <p>ofi - yep we definitely need to add rdoc style comments for API documentation. We also want to add some kind of syntax to DRYML so that tags can have comments in the source code which can be extracted.</p>
    
    <p>It's interesting that you don't find the beta.hobocentral.net idea to be as important - most people seem to be crying out for examples more than anything else.</p>
    
    <p>I guess we just need everything :-)</p>

This release is mainly about fixes - problems recently reported in the forums with the migration generator and validation error pages have been fixed. Of course we sneaked in a bunch of new features too, and James has been busy making the Clean theme even nicer.
