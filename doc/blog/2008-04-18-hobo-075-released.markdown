    <p>jim - why do you suggest uninstaling will_paginate?</p>
    
    <p>I <em>think</em> these glitches are just related to the gem servers catching up. I've seen the same thing happen with Rails releases.</p>

    <p>I was fustrated by my previous attempts to run the hobo tutorials and that was the reason of my biter reply to your previous post.
    Now I am amazed by how fast things get better here. Congratulations!
    For people like me, not hobo, rails or even ruby experts, but interested in how this "stack" can simplify web development, you should provide an easy first experience. Once commited we will eventually go in the deep parts of everything, but dont ask it beforehand.
    Now the "agility" app runs in my machine and I still get error 500 but it is because the tutorial doesnt tell us to construct the story_status class.
    Another posible bug (WinXp)is the fact that the migration doesnt take place after choosing "m" at the prompt. I solved it doing rake db:migrate</p>

    <p>First of all: Hobo is freakin' awesome! Really!
    And the new documentation (tutorial) is also good, and got me hooked.</p>
    
    <p><em>One question though:</em>
    Are there any ready themes out there yet, except clean? I really liked the one of the old screencasts. Is there a repository with available themes somewhere?</p>
    
    <p>If not, how about going the Typo-way, and starting a Theme contest sometime? Cause plug-n-play Theme-support rocks!</p>

    <p>hi all, </p>
    
    <p>just ran into the same problem (on ubuntu):</p>
    
    <p>hobo: command not found. 
      I guess that in the hobo-gem no symlink is created. 
      You can do this by hand: 
      Try: sudo ln -s /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/hobo-0.7.5/bin/hobo /usr/bin/hobo</p>
    
    <p>Hopefully this gets fixed soon. </p>
    
    <p>the other problem: ...no such file or directory...
    During setup  hobo.rb is not creating the 'plugins' directory
    in vendor/plugins/.  fileutils is complaining about that. 
    I believe this is a bug and should be fixed. 
    - sorry - i could not find a workaround. </p>
    
    <p>Greets - alex.</p>

Hobo 0.7.5 is a fairly small release in terms of new features, but does tidy up a few things and fixes some bugs that were causing people trouble. The bigger news is that there's a whole bunch of new documentation now available.

<a id="more"></a><a id="more-200"></a>

To upgrade simply

	gem update hobo
	
or grab the files from github or the svn repo and update your plugin directories.

A highlight of some of the changes.

 - Autocompleters and in-place-editors have been broken for a while. They're working again now
 - Some incompatibilities with older REXML versions have been addressed. DRYML should now work with REXML versions 3.1.4 to 3.1.7.3
 - The "permission denied" page should be working again.
 - The Clean theme works much better in IE6 now.
 - We've squished a pagination bug that was messing a few people up

There's a bunch more little changes -- see the [changelog](http://github.com/tablatom/hobo/tree/master/hobo/CHANGES.txt) for the full low-down.

Then on the tidying up side, there are two major changes. First, we've moved to gems for the whole of hobo. Installing the `hobo` gem should get you `hobosupport`, `hobofields` and `will_paginate`. As a result of this the `hobo` command no longer tries to fetch anything with subversion.

And we've made a change to the structure of the git repo. Because Hobo is really one project, with some sub-components available as spin-offs, it is really much better to have the whole thing in a single repo. So [github.com/tablatom/hobo](http://github.com/tablatom/hobo) now also contains `hobosupport` and `hobofields` in sub-directories. The separate repos on github for HoboSupport and HoboFields will be deleted soon. The one downside is that you can no longer follow "edge Hobo" by using git sub-modules, because git doesn't support partial exports. We'll provide some rake tasks to make that easier at some point.

And then there's the docs.

We've got the very beginnings of a complete reference to the Rapid tag libraries. At the moment it's just generated from the source-code but all we need to do now is start adding in-line documentation comments. The format is probably not ideal either - it doesn't lend itself to easily searching the whole library. We'll improve that too in time.

The manual has been extended to include a fairly comprehensive guide to customising Hobo's RESTful model controller. 

James has added some great insights into working with DRYML in the third part of the POD tutorial and with some additions to the DRYML guide.

And finally there's our first HOW-TO: adding an admin sub-site to a Hobo app. We've got a bunch more of these planned which should be very useful. 

So! We're making good on our promise to concentrate less on features and more on making Hobo accessible to others. Mind you, having said that, there's a cracking new feature in the pipeline...
