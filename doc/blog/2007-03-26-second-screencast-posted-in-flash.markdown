    <p>By backwards-compatible, what version are you targeting?</p>
    
    <p>I suggest uploading it to Google video, and let them take care of the player and converting the file.</p>
    
    <p>On several high-traffic university sites I use On2's Flix exporter for Quicktime, with Flash 8 (VP6) video compression, and the open-source FLV player. </p>
    
    <p>Chances are good (>97%) that anyone who clicks a link to play a "Flash Video" has at least version 8 of the player installed.</p>

A few folk seem to be having trouble with the audio in the second screencast. We've just posted a rough [Flash version](http://screencasts.hobocentral.net/pod-tabla.SWF) as a stop-gap solution. The quality is a bit naff but it's better than not being able to hear anything!

If anyone can recommend a nice tool for converting QuickTime to a good quality backwards-compatible Flash movie, please let us know in the comments. Thanks!
