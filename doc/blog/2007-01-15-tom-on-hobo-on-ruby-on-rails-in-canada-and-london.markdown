  Just thought I'd let you know there are going to be a couple of opportunities to see me rambling on about Hobo. One soon and local, the other not so much.

On 9th February, there's a Rails "mini-conf", hosted by [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com). Skills Matter are the training company who run the Rails course written by [Chad Fowler](http://chadfowler.com) and delivered by yours truly and others.

*  [Skills Matter RoR eXchange](http://www.skillsmatter.com/#rorexchange)

I'm also very happy to say I've been invited to present on Hobo at the Canada on Rails conference in October in Toronto. A big thank-you to [Nathaniel Brown](http://www.nshb.net/) for the invite.

* [Canada on Rails 2007](http://canadaonrails.com/news/show/23)

Really looking forward to both of these events!

p.s. Hobo 0.4.1 is *just* around the corner.
