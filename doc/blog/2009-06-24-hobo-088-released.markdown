    <p>The two minute Hobo tutorial does not work. In fact, none of the Hobo tutorial works. It's totally useless for beginners.</p>
    
    <p>You need to update the documentation before it becomes a useful tool!!!! :-(</p>

    <p>Arturo -- sorry no progress yet in that department, although there is a fork with i18n support. Please search the hobousers group. I can't tell you much about it though</p>

    <p>Does Hobo work with Facebook? I am trying to write a Facebook Canvas application. Is Hobo the right tool for the job? I am trying to use it with Facebooker plugin.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks</p>

    <p>@Anonymous no. 10 -- fortunately Hobo itself is a lot more alive than the blog. We are still making steady progress towards a 1.0 release.</p>
    
    <p>@raymond -- I honestly have no idea : ) but I see you've posted on the forums so maybe someone else has an idea.</p>

Go grab Hobo 0.8.8 : )

Actually I only *just* published the gems so don't forget that Rubyforge takes a while to get its act together.

I'm really posting this on behalf of Bryan who's done pretty much all the work in this release - thanks Bryan! And thanks to Owen and the guys at Barquin for their continued support.

This release is mostly bug fixes. The low-down, as usual, is in the [changelog](/gems/CHANGES.txt)

Oh one more thing. We liked the fresh new look in the previous post so much that it's now the Hobo default. (that doesn't mean you need ImageMagick, we just included the generated PNG files in the Clean theme)

Enjoy!
