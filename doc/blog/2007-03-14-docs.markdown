 * [A Concise Introduction to DRYML](/blog/docs/a-concise-introduction-to-dryml/)

# The Hobo Tutorial

**Stop Press!** The new, improved and up-to-date (Hobo 0.7.1) tutorial is now available!

 * [Hobo Tutorial](/tutorial)

# beta.hobocentral.net

Not only that, but the source-code to [beta.hobocentral.net](http://beta.hobocentral.net) is available! The idea is that this source-code will heavily commented in order to act as a form of documentation. At the moment there's not a huge amount there, but the model layer has a few nuggets of knowledge in the comments. Also note that a lot of the functionality can be found in `vendor/plugins` as reusable Hobo bundles. More coming!

`svn checkout svn://hobocentral.net/hobo/trunk/hobocentral`
