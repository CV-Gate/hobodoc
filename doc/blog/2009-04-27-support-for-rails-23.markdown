    <p>Working great for me so far.  Note that the page is a little misleading, saying it tells you how to upgrade but providing no link as to how one actually can get Edge Hobo.</p>

    <p>I'm starting a Hobo based web for managing rugby players info (personal, technical, medical, nutritional, ...). 
    I don&acute;t know how to extend the Projects->Stories->Tasks examples to the many subordinated models like:
      Players -> Personal info -> Id Documents
              -> Technical records -> Technical Attributes
              -> Physical performance -> Measurements
    and so on.
    Any help will be apreciated.
    Thanks.</p>

    <p>It shows me error ......</p>
    
    <p>You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!
    You might have expected an instance of Array.
    The error occurred while evaluating nil.<<</p>
    
    <p>any ideas ??</p>

    <p>Sandip, Lucas:</p>
    
    <p>Your best bet for answers is to post details on what you're trying to do, along with a backtrace, to the Hobo Users mailing list:  http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers</p>
    
    <p>Lucas:  Ruby 1.9 support is still in the works.   We hope it's close.</p>

Edge Hobo finally includes support for Rails 2.3.&nbsp; Edge Hobo should
continue to be backwards compatible with Rails 2.2.&nbsp; This support is
new, so please help us out by testing it on your application.

You can upgrade your application to use Rails 2.3 very simply:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo gem install rails -v 2.3.2
    sed -i 's/2.2.2/2.3.2/g' config/environment.rb
    rake rails:update</pre>
Nested Model Forms
------------------

Rails 2.3 adds support for nested model forms.&nbsp; Hobo has included
support for nested model forms for quite some time now.&nbsp; This has not
been removed from Hobo, so you now have two mechanisms for nested
model forms:

Hobo style:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has_many :stories, :accessible => true, :dependent => :destory</pre>
Rails 2.3 style:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has_many :stories, :dependent => :destory
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks, :allow_destroy => true</pre>
After Hobo 1.0 is released we may decide to migrate Hobo over to the
Rails 2.3 style nested models.&nbsp; But Hobo 1.0 will support Rails 2.2
and therefore must include its own nested model support.
