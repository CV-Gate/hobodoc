It was 17 and a half hours in the end but we seem to have made it. Although without a great deal of surplus energy for a riveting blog post!

Hope you enjoy the new site -- we've tried to have a bit of fun with it :-). Also don't miss: two new [screencasts](/screencasts.php), the [docs](/blog/docs), and of course [Hobo 0.5](/blog/getting-started) ([changelog](/gems/CHANGES.txt)).

Let me know what breaks!

ZZZZZzzzzzz...
