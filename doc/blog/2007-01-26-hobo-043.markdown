    <p>Thanks for this rails complements/addons.</p>
    
    <p>I found that the Forums/Mailing List is empty. I think that is necesary to implement this now. An temporary option could be to generate a google groups o similar. This option is selected by AjaxScaffold by example.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <p>I just did the Pod demo, and it worked perfectly. Smashing job, as some outside of the states say.  For what it's worth, I did run into this warning on a new project:</p>
    
    <p><code>./script/../config/boot.rb:29:Warning: require_gem is obsolete.  Use gem instead.
    </code></p>
    
    <p>I am using Locomotive on a Mac and Rails version 1.2.1.</p>

    <p>Carl,</p>
    
    <p>While require_gem was deprecated in gem version 0.9.0, the bin stubs are still using it. To get rid of the warnings printed by rake or other bin stubs simply run 'gem pristine --all'.</p>

Let's see... what to tell you about the new stuff? There's a nice little DSL for integration tests. Most of the goodness is already there with Rails (See [Jamis Buck's blog post](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/3/9/integration-testing-in-rails-1-1)). I've just added a few convenient methods for testing basic stuff like creating and viewing objects. Here's a snippet from a test of the POD demo:

	def test_user_creating
  	  fred = fred_session
      new_ad = fred.creates_and_visits(Advert, 
		                               :title => "my car",
		                               :body => "is a nice car",
		                               :category => cars)
      fred.sees new_ad.title
      fred.sees new_ad.body
    
      fred.cant_create(User, :username => "Jim")
      fred.cant_create(Category,
                       :name => "small furry creatures")
    end

Neat eh?

Enjoy.
