Hobo 0.8.4 is out of the door. Score! Could you ask for more? Rest assured there is plenty more in store.

In addition to the usual slew of small improvements, the main features of this release are:

 - Completely new and much improved [permission system](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/permissions)
 - Not *completely* new but much improved [lifecycles](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/lifecycles)
 - The beginnings of a new "View Hints" system -- a place to declare things that don't belong in the model, but help Rapid create the right UI.

Yes those two links are to detailed documentation - wonders will never cease!

Please note that Hobo 0.8.4 requires Rails 2.2.2.See the [changes](/gems/CHANGES.txt) for the details. Please remember that Rubyforge takes a good while to get with the program, so `gem update hobo` might not work for a while. You can download the gem files from Rubyforge manually though.In other news the [Hobo Cookbook](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net) continues to outgrow its name and is now the home of the Agility tutorial.

Enjoy!
