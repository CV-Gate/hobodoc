    <p>I updated to 0.6.2 with gem and generated a new project with the hobo command. Running rake in the fresh project directory however yields
    <code>rake aborted!
    superclass mismatch for class Annotation
    /home/logankoester/projects/pagetubes/trunk/freshproject/Rakefile:10</code></p>
    
    <p>Any thoughts on this?</p>

    <p>Logan - I used to get this error when the specs were contained inside Hobo. The specs contain a mini Rails app which in turn contains the whole of edge Rails which was causing this problem.</p>
    
    <p>Ah! Did you do <code>hobo --svn</code> ? I forgot to update the SVN path in the <code>hobo</code> script. ... Just uploaded the fix to rubyforge</p>

    <p>I'm also getting an error trying to run the hobo command with 0.6.2. I tried 0.6.1 and got the same error. I'm on Windows and it's getting an error in mkdir. I downgraded to 0.5.3 (which I happened to have) and it's working again. Any ideas?</p>

There's a subtle blend of fixes and small enhancements in this release. Enjoy!

 * [Changes](/gems/CHANGES.txt)

*REPOSITORY LAYOUT CHANGE*: Please note the svn url for the plugin has changed. It is now:

 * `svn://hobocentral.net/hobo/trunk/hobo`
 
If you check out `svn://hobocentral.net/hobo/trunk` you'll get both `hobo` and `hobo_spec`, and you'll be able to run the specs by typing `rake` in the `hobo` directory. The specs are very thin on the ground right now but that will improve as we migrate our old test/unit tests to specs.
