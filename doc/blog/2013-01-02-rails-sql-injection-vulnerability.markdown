    <p>I was initially under the impression that they weren't going to release a fix for 3.0, but 3.0.18 has also been released.   If you upgrade to Rails 3.0.18, there is no need to upgrade to Hobo 1.3.3; it is otherwise identical to Hobo 1.3.2.</p>

A SQL injection vulnerability has been found in ActiveRecord that
impacts all versions of Rails:

[CVE-2012-5664](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/DCNTNp_qjFM)

I have released Hobo 1.3.3 that patches Hobo's vulnerability to this issue.

if you are using Hobo 2.0 it is recommended that you upgrade to Rails
3.2.10, although I have also pushed the security patch to github
master.

The Hobo fix only impacts Hobo's usage.   If you use find\_by\_ in your
own code, you must fix those up yourself by coercing the input
(`find_by_foo(params[:foo].to_s1)` for example) or by upgrading to a
version of Rails without the vulnerability.
