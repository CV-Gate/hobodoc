I'm pleased to announce the release of Hobo 1.0RC3 (AKA 0.9.104).  We hope that this will be the last release candidate before 1.0.

A large amount of the effort between the last two releases has gone into testing and into the [documentation](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/toc).

Here's the changelog:

[#604](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/604):

The new input-many introduced in 0.9.103 had issues with >10 elements,
several issues running with IE7 and an issue with its javascript
callbacks.

[#537](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/537):

`x._?.to_s` now returns nil rather than a blank string

[#592](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/592): 

If you previously had a snippet such as this:

    <table fields="this, date, account.login">
      <login-view:>
        ...
      </login-view:>
    </table>

You now have to use:

    <table fields="this, date, account.login">
      <account-login-view:>
        ...
      </account-login-view:>
    </table>

The same change has been applied to `<field-list>`

[#568](https://hobo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8324/tickets/568):

`hobo_index` now supports the `:scope` option
