To coincide with the release of Hobo 0.8.6, the cookbook and the tutorials have been updated.

The agility tutorial is now a **gitorial**, a tutorial made with [git](http://git-scm.com).  This shouldn't affect you much but it does give you a few more options when running through the tutorial.  This should also give you more confidence that we haven't let errors creep into the tutorial!

Besides numerous typos and errors being fixed, there are two new chapters in the agility tutorial: [User Activation](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/tutorials/agility#adding_user_activation) and [Integration Testing](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/tutorials/agility#integration_testing)

The User manual has a new chapter:  [Hobo Scopes](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/scopes).   The [HoboFields](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/hobofields) and [HoboSupport](
http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/hobosupport) doctests have been updated and included in the manual.

The cookbook now includes an additional section:  [Third Party Plugins](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/plugins).  Submit your plugin and join the party!
