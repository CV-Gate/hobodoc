    <p>Another game changer? Trust me, 1.0 is a game changer for me. I've been working through examples and the book, and I'm very impressed. I think I might actually get some rails sites developed now that I have Hobo! Please keep up the good work, and I look forward to moving on from the "newb" stage to being able to contribute also.</p>
    
    <p>GOOD JOB AND GOOD LUCK!</p>

    <p>Just a quick note: Hobo 1.0.0 is essentially unchanged from the last release candidate, so hopefully everybody finds it just as stable as the beta testers in the community.</p>

    <p>Congratulations :) The two books are priceless - I have used them many times! Something that would be very useful is having examples in the Hobo Cookbook Taglibs.</p>
    
    <p>Have you thought about creating short hobo screencasts? like Railscasts.com</p>
    
    <p>Best regards

    <p>Congratulations!</p>
    
    <p>I have been testing Hobo since its first releases and I must say I am impressed by all the work done. The cookbook is now very good. It gives users a great start with Hobo. The hobo migration is one of the best tools/plugins I have ever tested on Rails. The way it generate migrations for me is just great and it saves me time.</p>

    <p>Tom, really impressed with what you and your team have accomplished.  Thanks to Owen, I have become an ardent fan of Ruby on Rails and Hobo.  I was a little hesistent to pursue hobo as bleeding edge technologies can be just that, but that&rsquo;s not the case at all with Hobo.  It&rsquo;s a game changer.  Keep putting the time in the documentation, it will pay off.  I now need to get the rest of our Java developers tuned in and moving in that direction.  Why keep making it difficult when it can be so much simpler, Occam&rsquo;s razor, the simplest solution is usually the right one.</p>

    <p>Big congrats guys! I am yet to see something as good as the Rails + Hobo (or Rails + ActiveScaffold) duo on Java land.</p>
    
    <p>Can't wait to go back to ruby work/study and dive deeper into Hobo - I'm still impressed by the first look I gave it many months ago.</p>

    Buisness value right out of the box! 100% focus to solve reel thing's. Well done!</p>

title: Hobo 1.0 Released!

We did it! More than three years after the original open-source release of the Hobo beta, version 1.0 is finally here.

Go get it!

    gem update hobo

or

    gem install hobo


I for one never thought it would take that long! But then the project has changed such a lot. In the early days we thought the automatic UI provided by Hobo would be a good starting point, but not much more. As we went on we noticed more and more patterns in web UIs, patterns we could capture in Hobo. As a result you can now get a surprisingly usable app for almost no effort beyond creating your models.

Of course from there you can customise things to your heart's content - that was the goal right from the start and it hasn't changed.

Along the way we added some killer features too. Writing migrations by hand is pretty much a thing of the past in Hobo apps, since we added the [migration generator](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/hobofields) (also available with the rest of Hobo!). Hobo's [lifecycles](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/lifecycles) make it so much easier to implement multi-step processes, you get a UI to your lifecycles with little or no code, and there's even support for secure links in email messages (for implementing things like forgotten-password and account-activation).

We've also put a huge effort into getting Hobo documented. We've built a community driven documentation site - [cookbook.hobocentral.net](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net), which is also the home of the extensive [manual](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/toc). There's a new introductory [screencast](http://hobocentral.net). Oh and there's two [books](/books) available to download, and a third on the way!

Perhaps more importantly than any of that, there's a thriving and very friendly [community](http://staging.hobocentral.net/community/). One of the most consistent comments we get from developers is how much they appreciated all the help and support they got while building their first Hobo app.  Be sure to check out all the cool [apps](/gallery/) they've built.

For myself personally, and on behalf of the whole Hobo community, a huge thank-you goes out to all the people that helped us get here. In the beginning there was [Line Learning & Communications](http://line.co.uk) and [Jiva Technology](http://jivatechnology.com/), who contributed enormously by choosing Hobo for major projects, and of course my coding partner on those projects and the early version of Hobo, James Garlick. James' keen sense of aesthetics has had huge impact on the design of Hobo, inside and out. We had a good laugh too!

Today of course there's Owen Dall, Ramon Barquin, and the team at [Barquin International](http://barquin.com). Owen spotted us at an early stage. He saw in Hobo a vision for the future and took a big bet on us. Barquin's sponsorship has made Hobo 1.0 possible. Thanks Owen! There are too many people in the open-source community to thank individually, but a mention has to go to core contributors Matt Jones and Bryan Larsen -- as you know, it's been you guys much more than me that have polished things off, fixed the bugs, and got us to 1.0. And in the background all along, unseen by most, is my business partner, coach, cheerleader, agony-uncle and general strategist, the one and only [Mr. Nigel Powell](http://redferret.net). Well done everyone!

At this point it is customary to say "and this is only the beginning!". In this case however, it's not just an up-beat signing off remark. I've not actually been committing loads of code to Hobo in the last few months while Matt and Bryan have got us to 1.0. The reason is, I've been in the back room, quietly tinkering, tweaking, experimenting, honing. The next chapter in this story could just be a game-changer. Stay tuned.
