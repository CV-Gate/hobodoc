    <p>Hey,</p>
    
    <p>Really enjoyed your talk on hobo at railsconf in berlin ! You are absolutely right in that the view side of the framework is way beyond other parts of rails in productivity. I will definitely give hobo a tryout soon.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks
    Leo</p>

So who's going? Leave a comment.

It would be great to have some kind of Hobo hackathon one evening. There's nothing formally arranged but I'd imagine we could find a room to squeeze into somewhere.

See you there!
