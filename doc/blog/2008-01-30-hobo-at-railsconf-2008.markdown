    <p>I've registered and have signed up for the Hobo session.  You presenting on Hobo was one of several things that pushed me over the edge of deciding to shell out the money and take off the time to go.  So I'm expecting great things!  no pressure, though ;)</p>

Seems it's conference season :-)

We are very excited to be presenting a [three hour hands-on Hobo tutorial](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/1895) at RailsConf in Portland, Oregon!
