    <p>That's the tutorial I used to learn it.  Whether it's the best, I'm not sure.</p>

Want a great way to learn more about Hobo and help out our community at the same time?  Writing documentation is one of the best ways to thoroughly learn something!

Now that Hobo has gone into code freeze for 2.0, we need to make sure that our documentation is fully updated before we release 2.0 to the masses.

There's some new documentation that I plan to write, but much of the work involves updating the manual.   I've written a fairly extensive [changes document](http://cookbook-1.4.hobocentral.net/manual/changes14), so it's mostly a matter of ensuring that those changes get propogated out to the appropriate manual sections, and/or creating corresponding manual sections in the case of new features.   While you're in a page, it would be nice if you could put in more synonyms so search works better for people who search for "dropdown" when we call it a select, et cetera.     Links to Rails documentation when appropriate would also really help people.

It's really easy to get started -- there's an "edit this page link" on pretty much every manual page!

Another fun project that's suitable for a beginner-intermediate Hobo programmer is to update the agility gitorial.   It was done using [stacked git](http://www.procode.org/stgit/) with the tutorial text in the commit messages and the code changes in the commits themselves.   Once you've installed stacked git, you can download the source for the agility gitorial at https://github.com/Hobo/agility-gitorial-patches.

The cookbook could also use some loving, so if anybody wants to take a crack at it, the source is available at https://github.com/tablatom/hobocookbook.   I've got a long list of things that I'd like to add to the cookbook, they're included in the [hobo TODO](https://github.com/tablatom/hobo/blob/master/hobo/TODO-1.4.txt), and I'm sure it's not difficult to think of some improvements of your own.   Contact me if you want more info on those terse one liners.

Thanks in advance to anybody who helps out!
