    <p>I missed one major improvement:</p>
    
    <p>The generator no longer adds <code>rails-dev-tweaks</code> to your Gemfile, instead it adds <code>quiet_assets</code>.   It also adds</p>
    
    <pre><code>config.watchable_dirs[File.join(config.root, 'app/view')] = ['dryml']
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>to your config/environments/development.rb</p>
    
    <p>I recommend making those changes to any Rails 3.2 app, whether it's running 2.0.0.pre2 or not.</p>

We're proud to announce the release of Hobo 2.0.0.pre2. Although the
core has been frozen, this release contains some major changes around
the periphery.

### Hobo/will_paginate now required

Our monkey patches to will\_paginate have been removed from Hobo.   Hobo 2.0.0.pre2 applications require the Hobo fork of will_paginate to operate.   Add this to your Gemfile:

    gem "will_paginate", :git => "git://github.com/Hobo/will_paginate.git"

### bottom-load-javascript

The `<page>` tag has a new attribute: `bottom-load-javascript`. If
set, Javascript is loaded via a deferred load at the bottom of the
body rather than being loaded conventionally in the head.   This can provide a very considerable speed-up to your pages.

You probably want to enable this globally in your application by
adding this to your application.dryml:

    <extend tag="page">
      <old-page bottom-load-javascript merge/>
    </extend>

Note that if this option is set, the custom-scripts parameter is no
longer available. There is a new parameter called custom-javascript
that can be used instead, though.

Replace:

    <custom-scripts:>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function() {
          alert('hi');
        });
      </script>
    </custom-scripts:>

with:

    <custom-javascript:>
      alert('hi');
    </custom-javascript:>

If you wish to be compatible with both top & bottom loading use:

    <custom-javascript:>
      $(document).read(function() {
        alert('hi');
      })
    </custom-javascript:>

If you were previously loading files via custom-scripts, use the asset
pipeline instead.

Turning on bottom-load-javascript will prevent Rails from splitting front.js into
multiple files even if you enable config.assets.debug in your
environment.

### improved unit & integration testing

Gemfiles and tweaks were added to make it easier to run the unit
tests. The agility integration test suite was added to core Hobo.  See the [README](https://github.com/tablatom/hobo/blob/master/README) for instructions on how to run tests.

### bug fixes

several bug fixes landed in Hobo 2.0.0.pre2. See the change log for
more details. One notable fix was to the jquery-ui datepicker support.
If you localize your dates, you may experience changed behaviour.
Fixes also landed for PostGIS, the spinner, reset-form, refocus-form,
ajax forms and name-one.
