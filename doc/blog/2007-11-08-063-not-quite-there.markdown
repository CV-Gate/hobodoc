    <p>Hi, </p>
    
    <p>read in the changelog that "the theme
    system going to change radically in Hobo 0.7". Is Hobo 0.7 Theme system downward compatible, or does it mean, all what I have done in the existing system must be reworked ?</p>
    
    <p>I didn't start to use Hobo, but I wanted to do it right now. Knowing this let me think: Better wait for Hobo 0.7. </p>
    
    <p>cheers -- j.erik</p>

It turns out that some of the changes in 0.6.3 have totally broken the "out of the box" Hobo app (which TBH is something we don't look at very much over here). It's getting into a better shape now -- hopefully tomorrow (TM)
