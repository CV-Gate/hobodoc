Just pushed to rubygems.org - Hobo 1.0.1. This release contains some bug fixes and performance enhancements. Just

    gem update hobo

There are two speedups: one that reduces the number of database accesses by Matt Jones and one that speeds up compilation of
DRYML by Petteri R&auml;ty.

If you're interested in the details of what got fixed, take a look at the [commit log on github](http://github.com/tablatom/hobo/tree/v1.0.1).

Thanks very much to everyone who contributed!

Meanwhile work continues on Hobo 1.1. Watch this space : )
