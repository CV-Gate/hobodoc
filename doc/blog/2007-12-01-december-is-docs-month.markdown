    <p>Excellent news!  I can't wait to use unified tags.  Will 0.7 include The Great Decoupling?</p>

    <p>Wow, you're optimistic Bronson :-) No - the decoupling won't  be a Hobo release but rather a bunch of sub-project releases as they are ready</p>

    <p>I understand the value of the beta website, but a current how-to for getting started with 0.7 on Rails 2.0.1 would be a very, very high value effort.</p>

    <p>I secound Paul's comment.  Could we move to update the how to for those trying to use hobo for the first time.  I myself would love to try what seems like a great tool but the lack of upto date documentation is a very big turn off.</p>

title: December is docs month!
excerpt: |+
  You believe me, don't you?
  
  OK, OK -- I missed my self imposed deadline. November came and went and you folk are still left perusing the source-code. I checked the "November is docs month" post and I did say "no guarantees" :-) Such is life. I have no idea how November managed to get so busy but it did.
  
  On the whole though, I'd have to say that things are looking pretty darn good for this little project.

Hobo 0.7 is essentially ready -- I've even written the changelog. This release features the long dreamt of (by me and James at least) unification of template tags and, er, the other kind of tag, you know, the normal ones. There is no um-ing and er-ing any more because now there's just tags. They're template-like if that's what you want, and not if you don't. It's really rather nice, and makes DRYML feel pretty much done, baring all the little clean-up jobs and performance enhancements between here and 1.0. That's a big deal.

I'm fairly confident in saying that beta.hobocentral.net, a.k.a. annotated Hobo-app goodness, is going to be out before you know it. I'll be starting on it first-thing Monday. 

And finally, our financial stability seems to have had a bit of a boost with a new client on the scene who are interested in using Hobo for a chunky-sized web-app. I might be able to share more about them at some point.
