Kevin has been making steady progress converting the MS Word version of the book into Lyx and making changes from Suzannah's  edits.

We hope that using the LyX layouts and using a public Github repo will make it easier to manage edits and updates, and provide a better framework for you to contribute and "roll-your-own" version of the book.

If you would like to follow along, the Github repo can be found at:

Cheers,

Owen
