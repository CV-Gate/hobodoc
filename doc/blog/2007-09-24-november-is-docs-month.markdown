    <p>Nice! I'm looking forward to the new documentation.</p>
    
    <p>I've recently upgraded a project to the latest hobo and whew... it was a task.</p>
    
    <p>Fortunately all the browsing of the hobo source that was necessary has made me a better programmer and I have learnt far more about several technologies than I would have were the process simpler. ;)</p>

    <p>Tom, I think this is a great idea! I'm looking forward to getting back to working with hobo after half a  year's hiatus.. I think it would be really helpful for novices if there was a 'getting started' doc which covered how to get started with the new bits and then one can go from there and read the source.. (nothing beats the docs, but a new up-to date getting started with the latest version would go a long way.)</p>
    
    <p>thanks for sharing your hard work with the rest of us and also for posting the slides, I hope the conference folks post the videos/audios soon.. lots of good talks happened there it seems..</p>

    <p>Tom, thats great to hear!
    I'm really looking forward to the docs (I think docs are far more important than screencasts - at least until the docs are at a usable level). I hope I can use Hobo in one of my next projects.
    Great work, great talk at railsconf and it was a pleasure talking to you wednesday morning</p>

    <p>I wrote a simple little getting started with hobo here</p>
    
    <p>http://sublimeguile.com/2007/09/25/getting-started-with-hobo/</p>
    
    <p>exactly because the screencasts were out of date.  I know that all the docs are important -- I'm planning on writing up more tutorials to help me figure things out.  But I would just like to vote for a pushing up a new screen cast in the schedule of the things.  The screencast give people an overview in a way that reading about it doesn't.  I think it's easier to go from the screencast, seeing what is supposed to happen, to looking at the source to figure out the details then starting from a write up.</p>
    
    <p>But that's just my opinion.</p>

    <p>I really like Hobo but I agree we need docs. I have some time available and would like to help in this area.</p>
    
    <p>I posted in trac but there was enough spam I was concerned my note would get lost. Please let me know if you are willing to let me clean-up the spam tickets and contribute to the documentation process.</p>
    
    <p>I realize that an offer like this in a blog comment is a bit strange, but I did not see a more direct method of contact.  I can video chat or call to talk more about it if you like.</p>

So after highlighting the fact that documentation is now soooo important, you must all be thinking "OK, so...?". The current situation is this. The Hobo team is getting towards the end of a large development project, and all going well we should have a decent chunk of time to give Hobo some TLC in November. So, no guarantees, but you can look forward to a much higher level of docs, and maybe even some shiny new screencasts towards the end of November.
