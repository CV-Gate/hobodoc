It's becoming increasingly common for people to get in touch with me asking for commercial help with their Hobo/Rails projects. It's a shame then, that these days I pretty much always have to say no. It's a shame for them, and it's a shame for Hobo itself, because the more individual Hobo projects succeed, the more Hobo itself succeeds.

Which is a roundabout way of saying that, if there are developers out there would would like commercial work on Hobo projects, I could probably send some their way. I don't want to be a middle man, and I definitely don't want to end up getting embroiled into projects that don't go smoothly, so... You'd need to be able to convince me that you know what you're doing, know how to handle clients professionally, and are pretty handy with Ruby and Rails, even if you don't (yet!) consider yourself a Hobo expert.

I even have a little project ready to go - something that James and I started but we're both too swamped to move it forward.

If you're interested, drop me a line at tom@tomlocke.com, subject "Hobo Project Work". Thanks!

Once we get to Hobo 1.0, we're thinking we might do something more structured along these via the hobocentral website. A job board for example, or perhaps even a Hobo consulting group, but for now we'll keep it simple.
