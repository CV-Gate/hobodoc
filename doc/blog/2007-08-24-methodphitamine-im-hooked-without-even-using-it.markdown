    <p>Consider packaging it up as a patch to Facets (http://facets.rubyforge.org/) and use that, rather than creating Yet Another Support Library.  (I'm looking at you, ActiveSupport)</p>

Now *[that](http://jicksta.com/articles/2007/08/04/the-methodphitamine)* is going straight into Hobo's core extensions. Thanks for sharing Jay!

Meaning I can finally get rid of all that `omap`, `oselect` nonsense (if you didn't notice those methods, don't even ask, it was a bad idea. If you did and you use them - stop!)

Hmmm. Maybe it's time to make this stuff available in a separate gem. `HoboSupport`? It's starting to bug me when I'm in a non-Hobo script and all this stuff is missing.

p.s. Hobo 0.6.1 coming today!
