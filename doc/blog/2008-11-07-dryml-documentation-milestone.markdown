    <p>Thank you. 
    Docs are good.
    Do you consider updating the old hobo screencast? It was this cast that got me "hooked" to Hobo. I suggest a alternative to rubyonrails standard webblog.</p>
    
    <p>It should be a <5min screencast.</p>

    <p>I also forgot.
    Cookbook site should get a "print preview" or PDF generation.</p>

    <p>MartOn - we are focusing on the docs for now. We will be doing new screencasts when the docs are in a good state.</p>

The DRYML Guide is finally finished. At long last, DRYML is "fully documented", whatever that means : ) You could easily write an entire book on DRYML (well, when I say easily, I mean you could easily find enough material in there!), but at least the whole language is covered now. At 24 pages when printed, it's fairly comprehensive.

Enjoy!

Now on to the [other chapers](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/manual/to-do) of the manual...
